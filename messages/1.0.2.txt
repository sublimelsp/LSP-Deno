=> 1.0.2

Some changes were made in the settings that require you to enable this
language server on a per-project basis. Meaning, use the command

    LSP: Enable Language Server in Project

from the Command Palette to enable it per window (or project). All
this command does is modify the project data of the window, so, you
can do this manually as well by editing your .sublime-project, if you
have one.

This change is more in line with how the server expects to be used in
clients.
